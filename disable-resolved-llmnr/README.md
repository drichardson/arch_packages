Disable Link Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)
----------------------------------------------------
LLMNR is Microsoft's version of ZeroConf/Apple's Bonjour. If you've
ever run `ss -lt` on a stock Arch Linux system and wondered what
llmnr was, this is it. If you don't care about link level name
resolution with Microsoft platforms, you can disable llmnr using
this package.
